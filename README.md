# PROPOSAL-TO-PREVENT-CRYPTOCURRENCY-SCAMS

<p>
  maybe cryptocurrency websites need to register for a digital badge that has to be displayed on the front page of the website (with a short serial number think 14-16 digits alpha numeric)

which will have a verifiable serial number that users can check the validity of a cryptocurrency website with a government website lookup tool (almost like verifying SSL certs)
and the government website will tell the user when they lookup a serial number from the cryptocurrency website (the website business name for the cryptocurrency website almost like looking up website domain information to verify a website is register to send and receive cryptocurrency or to even have cryptocurrency prizes for users)


users can copy the serial number and look up the serial number on a government website that keeps tracks of all public cryptocurrency websites and servers
ALMOST SIMILAR TO A MONEY TRANSMITTER LICENSE SERIAL NUMBER
BUT A CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSMITTER LICENSE
A CTL serial number
AND IT CAN BE LOW COST TO REGISTER A WEBSITE THAT DEALS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY FOR A REASONABLE COST FOR MOST WEBSITE AND CRYPTOCURRENCY OPERATORS THINK LESS THAN $100 OR LESS THAN $50
TO REGISTER A CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSMITTER LICENSE
